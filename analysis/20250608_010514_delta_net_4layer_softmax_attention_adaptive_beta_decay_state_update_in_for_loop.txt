1. Current MAD Results Recap
   – Vanilla DeltaNet already excels at long-range memory (Compress 0.44) and noise-robust tasks (Context & Noisy Recall ≈1.0) but falls short on
        • Fuzzy Recall ≈0.22 (≈ 70 % below Gated DeltaNet 0.31)
        • Memorize     ≈0.40 (< 0.59 of Gated DeltaNet)
        • Selective-Copy 0.95 (< 0.997)
   – Previous modifications show two main trends:
        • Optimiser-style state updates (Adam, RMSprop, Momentum) severely damage every metric ⇒ heavy implicit smoothing erases useful memories.
        • Simple decay / gating variants keep strong Context / Noisy recall but do NOT raise Fuzzy / Memorize.
        • Adding Softmax attention (without state decay) lifted Memorize to 0.78 – a 2× jump – but hurt Fuzzy Recall (0.16).  This hints that sharper (probability-normalised) attentional weights help binding but need better retention control.
   Conclusion: The bottleneck is still *association precision* (Fuzzy Recall) and *plasticity vs. stability* (Memorize vs. Compress).  Any new change must strengthen key-matching while avoiding wholesale forgetting.

2. New Modification Introduced (inside the chunk loop)
   delta_net_4layer_softmax_attention_adaptive_beta_decay_state_update_in_for_loop
   • Softmax-normalised causal attention  – replaces raw dot-products when mixing prediction errors u_i.  This bounds activations and forces competition between keys, sharpening fuzzy matching without destabilising gradients.
   • Adaptive β-driven decay of memory state S  –  β already encodes prediction-error magnitude.  We convert the *average β* of the current chunk into a forget gate γ = σ( \bar β ).  Update rule:
        S ← (1−γ)·S + k_iᵀ u_i
     Large errors → γ≈1 → quick overwrite (better plasticity / Memorize).  Small errors → γ≈0 → memory retained (better Compress, Noisy recall).
   Both operations are placed **inside the for-loop** directly after the output is written, respecting causality.

3. Expected Impact per MAD Task
   • Compress  – adaptive γ keeps γ→0 when β is small, so long-range information is preserved; should maintain or slightly improve ~0.44.
   • Fuzzy Recall  – probabilistic (softmax) attention emphasises the closest key even under 10 % perturbation ⇒ anticipated >0.31 (Gated DN).
   • Memorize  – we keep the strong boost (0.78 observed with softmax) while avoiding over-writing old pairs thanks to γ-controlled decay.
   • Noisy Recall & Context Recall  – unchanged mechanisms (error-driven update) + retention gate ⇒ should stay near 1.0.
   • Selective-Copy  – sharper attention + preserved memories give better distractor suppression ⇒ target ≥0.997.

4. Why Different from Previous Tries
   – Softmax attention had been tried **without** any state-decay; gating variants used additive decay **without** sharpening attention.  This combination addresses the two previously isolated problems in a single coherent rule.

5. File Updates
   • New variant saved to:
       /mnt/iem-nas/home/liuyixiu/AI_Archer/mad-lab/naive/delta_net_4layer_softmax_attention_adaptive_beta_decay_state_update_in_for_loop.py
   • Overwrote operational file:
       /mnt/iem-nas/home/liuyixiu/mad-lab/flash-linear-attention/fla/ops/delta_rule/naive.py
   Both compile and keep the same external API.

6. Next Steps
   – Re-run MAD benchmark to validate.  Key success criteria: Fuzzy Recall↑, Memorize≥Gated, keep others ≈baseline.
   – If Compress falls, tune γ mapping (e.g., γ = σ(κ·β̄) with κ<1).
