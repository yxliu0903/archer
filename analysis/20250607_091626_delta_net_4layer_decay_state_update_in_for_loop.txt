   (Averages)
   • DeltaNet-4L               ≈ 66.8 %
   • DeltaNet-4L + Momentum    ≈ 63.5 %
   • Gated-DeltaNet-4L         ≈ 71.0 %

2. Insights
   • Gated DeltaNet remains the best overall, mainly because it lifts the two weakest areas of plain DeltaNet – Memorize (+18 pp) and Fuzzy Recall (+9 pp) – while keeping its strengths (≈100 % on Context and Noisy Recall; ≈99.7 % on Selective Copy).
   • The momentum-based state update hurts: both Fuzzy (-7 pp) and Selective Copy (-7 pp) drop, so naïve momentum introduces too much inertia and interferes with rapidly-changing bindings.
   • All Delta-style variants already excel at noise-related tasks (> 99 %). Therefore the most valuable headroom lies in:
       – Fuzzy Recall (21–31 %)
       – Memorize   (40–59 %)
       – Compress   (37–44 %)

3. New modification proposed and implemented (inside the for-loop of delta_rule_chunkwise):
   Exponential decay of the memory matrix S before the outer-product update:
       S = decay * S + k_iᵀ @ u_i      with decay = 0.9
   Motivation
   • Catastrophic interference in Memorize/Fuzzy comes from stale, conflicting bindings that are never weakened.  A simple, differentiable forgetting factor clears room for fresh associations while still keeping high-priority memories alive for ≈10 steps (when decay = 0.9).
   • Retains causality: output o is computed first, then S is updated.
   • Minimal overhead, no extra parameters (decay could later be made learnable).

4. File updates
   • New variant saved to:
       /mnt/iem-nas/home/liuyixiu/AI_Archer/mad-lab/naive/delta_net_4layer_decay_state_update_in_for_loop.py
   • The same logic replaces the original implementation at:
       /mnt/iem-nas/home/liuyixiu/mad-lab/flash-linear-attention/fla/ops/delta_rule/naive.py

   Both files compile and keep the function signature unchanged.

Expected Impact
   – Should suppress accumulation of outdated information → higher Memorize accuracy.
   – By soft-resetting S every chunk, the network can form cleaner error-driven updates, which should also help Fuzzy Recall.
   – Little to no loss on tasks where DeltaNet already achieves ≈100 % because these rely on very recent bindings.
