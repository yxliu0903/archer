1. Overview of Existing Variants (accuracies_df.csv)
   • delta_net_4layer (baseline)
     – Strength: best Compress (0.442) & Noisy-Recall (0.997)
     – Weakness: Fuzzy-Recall (0.217) and Memorize (0.403) trail Gated-DeltaNet.
   • +Decay / +Error-Gated
     – Nearly identical to baseline; minor Fuzzy-Recall bump (→0.227) but Selective-Copy drops.
   • +LayerNorm / +Momentum
     – Both hurt Fuzzy-Recall (≤0.17) and give no Memorize gain.
   • +Softmax-Attention
     – Large Memorize jump to 0.779 and Selective-Copy 0.939, but Fuzzy-Recall still very low (0.16).

   Conclusion: So far we have not produced a variant that simultaneously beats Gated-DeltaNet on Fuzzy-Recall, Memorize and Selective-Copy – the sticking point is still Fuzzy-Recall.

2. Insight on Modification Effectiveness
   • Operations that change the *shape* of the error term (Decay, Error-Gate) mainly influence global stability, leaving noise-sensitive retrieval mostly unchanged.
   • Softmax inside the chunk provides sharper local attention and strongly helps Memorize, confirming that better key discrimination benefits ordered retrieval; yet, because it does not regularise the *magnitude* of memory updates, it does not improve noisy / fuzzy cases.
   • LayerNorm & Momentum normalise activations but lower effective learning-rate too much, impeding new associations – hence poor Fuzzy-Recall.

   Take-away: We need an update rule that (a) preserves strong learning for new pairs (helps Memorize) while (b) adaptively down-weights overly large or noisy updates (helps Fuzzy-Recall, Noisy-Recall) without erasing existing information.

3. NEW Proposal – RMSProp-Style Adaptive State Update (implemented inside the for-loop)
   Motivation
   • Prediction-error outer-product (grad) has highly variable scale across heads, time-steps and dimensions.
   • Large gradients corrupt memory and hurt fuzzy matching; small gradients in rarely used cells never get a chance to learn.
   • RMSProp (running second moment) equips every memory cell with its own adaptive learning-rate.  This keeps updates well-conditioned and should:
       – Filter out noisy spikes → better Fuzzy-/Noisy-Recall.
       – Still allow confident low-variance gradients to flow → keep or improve Memorize.

   Mathematical change inside for-loop (after producing output):
       grad = k_i^T @ u_i                    # classical delta update
       V   = ρ V + (1-ρ) grad^2             # second moment (per cell)
       S   = S + β̄ * grad / (√V + ε)       # adaptive step (β̄ = mean β in chunk)

   • ρ=0.9, ε=1e-8 ensure smooth, stable scaling.
   • Preserves causality because S is updated only *after* o for current chunk is written.

4. File Updates
   • Saved new variant code to:
       mad-lab/naive/delta_net_4layer_rmsprop_state_update_in_for_loop.py
   • Synchronized production implementation at:
       mad-lab/flash-linear-attention/fla/ops/delta_rule/naive.py

   Both keep the original function name `delta_rule_chunkwise`, satisfying import contracts.

5. Expected Impact relative to Gated-DeltaNet
   • Compress – unchanged (still strong)
   • Fuzzy-Recall – adaptive down-scaling of noisy updates should increase accuracy, aiming to close the 0.10 gap.
   • Memorize – retains Softmax-like high learning rate for consistent gradients, so should exceed 0.58 of Gated-DeltaNet.
   • Selective-Copy – improved stability plus existing attention scheme expected to push >0.997.

6. Next Steps
   • Re-run MAD benchmark with this variant.
   • If Fuzzy-Recall improves while Maintain/Increase Memorize, we will surpass Gated-DeltaNet’s average score and achieve the stated objective.
