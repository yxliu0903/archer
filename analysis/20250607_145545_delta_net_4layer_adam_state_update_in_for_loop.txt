Key insights
• Basic DeltaNet already excels at Context- & Noisy-Recall (>0.99) but struggles with Compress, Fuzzy-Recall and Memorize.
• Exp-Decay / Error-Gate barely move the needle; gains in Fuzzy/Compress are offset by drops in Selective-Copy.
• Momentum smoothing actually hurts across the board.  The memory becomes too sluggish.
• Adding a Softmax inside the local attention drastically boosts the Memorize task (0.78 → highest so far) and lifts the overall average to 0.712, finally beating Gated-DeltaNet (0.710).  However it sacrifices Fuzzy- & Compress accuracy, leaving room for improvement.

What DeltaNet Still Needs
1. Better *adaptive plasticity* — prevent large noisy updates that wipe out long-term memories (would help Compress & Fuzzy-Recall) while still allowing fast learning for Memorize.
2. Per-memory-slot discrimination — some keys change frequently, others should stay frozen.

New Modification Proposed & Implemented
---------------------------------------
"delta_net_4layer_adam_state_update_in_for_loop"
• Inside each chunk loop we now treat the outer-product update ΔS like a gradient and apply an **Adam-style adaptive step**:
    m_t = β₁·m_{t-1} + (1-β₁)·ΔS_t           (1st-moment)
    v_t = β₂·v_{t-1} + (1-β₂)·ΔS_t²          (2nd-moment)
    S_t = S_{t-1} + η · m_t / (√v_t + ε)
• Mathematical motivation: variance-normalised updates give high-variance (noisy) memory cells lower effective learning-rates, protecting stable memories needed for Compress / long-term recall, while low-variance cells adapt quickly (helps Memorize).
• Novelty: differs from earlier momentum / gating in that it uses *second-moment* scaling — a brand-new direction in these experiments.
• Implemented strictly after output write-back to keep causality; only the `for` loop body was changed.

Code Locations Written
1. /mad-lab/naive/delta_net_4layer_adam_state_update_in_for_loop.py (descriptive, reproducible)
2. /flash-linear-attention/fla/ops/delta_rule/naive.py (runtime path)

Expected Impact
• Compress & Fuzzy-Recall: adaptive damping should curb catastrophic overwrite, boosting scores.
• Memorize & Selective-Copy: retains fast adaptation for low-variance updates, so no regression is expected.
• Overall average should surpass the Softmax variant and further widen the gap with Gated-DeltaNet.
