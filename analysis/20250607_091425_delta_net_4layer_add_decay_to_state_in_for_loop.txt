Key insights
• Gated-DeltaNet clearly leads the pack (+0.04–0.07 absolute average) thanks to its chunk-wise gating: it drastically improves Memorize (+18-21 pts) and Selective-Copy (+5 pts) while keeping Compress/Noise levels comparable to plain DeltaNet.
• DeltaNet already excels at Context-Recall & Noisy-Recall (>0.99) but under-performs on Fuzzy-Recall and Memorize; momentum update deteriorates those two tasks further, indicating that naïvely adding momentum increases interference instead of helping memory formation.
• Therefore, any new modification must (1) retain DeltaNet’s noise robustness and in-context abilities, (2) close the gap on Memorize / Fuzzy-Recall, and (3) avoid hurting Compress.

New In-Loop Modification Introduced
───────────────────────────────────
Name:  delta_net_4layer_add_decay_to_state_in_for_loop
What & Where:  Inside the per-chunk for-loop, we multiply the previous memory state S by an adaptive exponential-decay factor before adding the usual delta outer-product update.
Mathematical change
    β̄_i  = mean_j β_{t=j in chunk i}
    S    ← (1 – β̄_i) · S  +  k_iᵀ · u_i
Motivation & Expected Benefits
• Memory capacity control: prevents S from growing indefinitely, alleviating saturation visible in low Memorize score.
• Error-adaptive forgetting: when the model is confident (large β̄) we allow stronger forgetting, freeing room for fresh associations; small β̄ keeps old memories.
• Minimal overhead: 1 scalar per (batch,head,chunk) and one extra mul, maintaining efficiency and causality.
Task-wise expectations
• Compress: Decay keeps only salient content → better reconstruction.
• Memorize: Reduces overwrite collisions → higher accuracy.
• Fuzzy / Noisy Recall: Core error-driven update unchanged → should stay ≥0.99.
• Selective-Copy: Lower interference improves precision, might match gated model.

Code Injection Points
• Only the state-update line inside the loop was changed (see naive.py lines around “# Exponential decay + delta update”).
• No function name / signature altered – fully drop-in compatible.

If future training/ablation confirm the reasoning, this single-file change should push DeltaNet beyond Gated-DeltaNet on average by specifically improving the two lagging tasks while preserving its strengths.
