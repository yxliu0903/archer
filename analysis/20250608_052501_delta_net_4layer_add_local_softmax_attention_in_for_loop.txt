Experiment Results Summary
==========================
1.  Baseline models
    • Mamba and GLA show strong **In-Context**, **Noisy-Recall** and **Selective-Copy** skills but fail badly on **Fuzzy-Recall** – a task that explicitly stresses noise-robust key matching.
    • DeltaNet replaces the additive update with the Delta-rule and immediately jumps from 6.7 → 35.7 % on Fuzzy-Recall while keeping perfect (≈100 %) scores on In-Context, Noisy-Recall and Selective-Copy.  The large gain confirms the theoretical claim that an error-driven outer-product update protects correct memories while selectively repairing wrong ones.

2.  Gated DeltaNet
    • Adding the exponential-decay gate further raises Fuzzy-Recall to 31 % and Memorize to 59 %.  The gate helps discarding outdated keys and therefore reduces interference in the densely packed Memorize task.  However, Compress deteriorates – the gate suppresses even useful information when an entire random sequence must be reproduced later.

3.  Previously tried modifications (CSV)
    • **Local/Global soft-max attention (delta_net_4layer_softmax_attention_in_for_loop)**
      – Memorize rockets to 0.78 (Δ +0.38 over baseline, +0.19 over Gated) by giving every token a direct attention path before being blended into the global state.
      – But Fuzzy-Recall plunges (0.16) because the un-normalised Delta update still dominates noisy keys.  Compress also drops slightly.
    • **Error-gated state update** raised Fuzzy-Recall marginally (0.23) and Memorize a bit (0.41) confirming that explicit gating can mitigate destructive updates, yet the gain is not enough to beat Gated DeltaNet.
    • **Optimiser-style updates (Momentum, Adam, RMSProp)** hurt every task except sometimes Compress, showing that heavy gradient dynamics during inference destabilise the associative memory.
    • **LayerNorm, pure decay, cosine similarity gates** give mixed or negative results – no single tweak simultaneously lifts Fuzzy-Recall and Memorize beyond the Gated baseline.

Key Insight
-----------
The outstanding challenge is to improve **Fuzzy-Recall** **and** **Memorize** without hurting Compress and Noisy-Recall.  Successful variants so far attacked either local matching (soft-max attention) **or** global stability (gates) but never both at once.

New Proposal
============
Name      : delta_net_4layer_add_local_softmax_attention_in_for_loop
Idea      : Keep the Delta-rule for long-range associative memory **and** add an extra *local, causal soft-max attention* path that operates only inside the current chunk before the update.
Rationale :
• The Delta-rule maintains global, noise-robust bindings (helps Noisy-Recall, In-Context, Compress).
• Local soft-max attention offers a high-resolution, noise-tolerant lookup of the raw (k, v) pairs inside the chunk – exactly what Fuzzy-Recall and Memorize need.
• Because the attention is restricted to past tokens of the same chunk and the global state **S** is still updated after the output is written, causality is preserved.
Expected Impact on MAD tasks
----------------------------
Task            | Expected effect
----------------|------------------------------------------------------------
Compress        | Unchanged – global state still memorises full sequence.
Fuzzy-Recall    | ↑ The local path can retrieve the correct value even when k is 10 % corrupted, reducing reliance on a possibly mis-updated S.
In-Context      | ≈ Same (already perfect).
Memorize        | ↑ Combines outer-product memory with direct key-value lookup → fewer collisions.
Noisy-Recall    | Maintained – Delta-rule already robust; local path provides extra denoising.
Selective-Copy  | Slight ↑ because local attention can skip distractors inside the chunk.

Implementation Notes (see code)
--------------------------------
Inside the main for-loop:
```
attn_local = softmax((q_i k_i^T) masked_causally)
o_local    = attn_local @ v_i
output     = o_inter + attn_global @ u_i + o_local   # combine paths
S          = S + k_i^T @ u_i                         # update after write
```
Only ~15 lines changed; all outer interfaces stay intact.

If the hypothesis holds, we should observe simultaneous improvements on Fuzzy-Recall and Memorize while keeping other tasks at least on par with Gated DeltaNet, thus meeting the stated objective.
