Key Findings
------------
• Gated DeltaNet still leads on overall average (0.710) because it lifts the two weakest DeltaNet skills: Fuzzy-Recall (+0.093) and Memorize (+0.184).  
• Among the earlier DeltaNet variants, “softmax-attn” soars on Memorize (0.779, +0.376) but sacrifices robustness in Fuzzy / Noisy Recall – suggesting that scaling the local attention helped storage but made the state more brittle to corruption.
• Momentum and plain decay did not help; they actually dampened learning signals and hurt both Compress & Fuzzy-Recall, indicating that uniform forgetting or sluggish updates cannot discriminate between useful and noisy gradients.
• Error-gating gave a consistent but minor lift (+0.01-0.02) to the three recall-type tasks, hinting that selective replacement is helpful but its step size is still too coarse.

Insight & Bottleneck
--------------------
DeltaNet’s limiting factor is *learning-rate heterogeneity*: the outer-product error update treats every (key,value) coordinate identically. Tasks such as Fuzzy / Noisy Recall require the model to apply *small* corrections for sporadically corrupted keys, whereas Memorize needs *large* cumulative updates for recurring pairs. A single β_t scale per token cannot satisfy both regimes, leading to either under-fitting (Fuzzy) or over-shooting (Memorize).

Proposed New Modification – Adam-style Adaptive Memory Update
-------------------------------------------------------------
Idea: view the delta-rule outer-product as a stochastic gradient on the memory S and apply Adam filtering *inside* the for-loop.
    m ← μ₁ m + (1-μ₁)·grad        (first moment)
    v ← μ₂ v + (1-μ₂)·grad²       (second moment)
    S ← S + lr · m / √(v+ϵ)       (adaptive step)
Benefits:
• Coordinate-wise learning-rate: high-variance cells get smaller steps → protects against noisy spikes (better Fuzzy/Noisy Recall).  
• Momentum accumulation: repeated gradients reinforce stable associations (boosts Memorize & Compress).  
• Normalised update magnitude keeps state bounded → stabilises very long sequences.
Implementation Highlights
• Two extra buffers m_S and v_S (same shape as S) live on-device, initialised to zeros.
• The adaptive update is executed **after** the output for the current chunk is written → causality preserved.
• Hyper-parameters (μ₁=0.9, μ₂=0.999, ϵ=1e-8, lr=1) are exposed for tuning.
• Only ~15 lines changed *inside* the existing for-loop; function name unchanged.
Expected Impact per Task
• Fuzzy & Noisy Recall: smoother, variance-aware updates damp noise, should close the gap to Gated.
• Memorize & Compress: momentum speeds convergence for repeated keys, likely surpass Gated.
• Context & Selective Copy: rely mostly on existing mechanism, should stay ≥ baseline.

2. Code Locations Updated
• New file saved to:  mad-lab/naive/delta_net_4layer_adam_state_update_in_for_loop.py  
• Production path overwritten: mad-lab/flash-linear-attention/fla/ops/delta_rule/naive.py

3. Next Steps
Run the MAD benchmark again with the new variant.  Fine-tune μ₁/μ₂ and lr on a small validation split; preliminary grid (lr∈[0.5,1.5]) is recommended.

If gains plateau, consider combining Adam update with the earlier softmax-attn (for Memorize) under a light gating term.
