1. Summary of Existing Results
• Baseline DeltaNet already excels at In-Context Recall (≈1.0), Noisy Recall (≈1.0) and Selective-Copy (≈0.95) but remains weak on Compress (0.44), Memorise (0.40) and especially Fuzzy-Recall (0.22).
• Gated-DeltaNet pushes the overall average to ≈0.71 mainly by raising Fuzzy-Recall (0.31) and Memorise (0.59) but still leaves room for improvement.
• Previous one-file modifications show the following trends:
  – Adding exponential decay or momentum barely changes the weak Fuzzy-Recall scores (still ≈0.14-0.23).
  – LayerNorm/softmax attention improve Memorise (softmax jumps to 0.78) yet Compress & Fuzzy-Recall remain the bottleneck.
  – Optimisation-based Adam / RMSProp updates destroy performance, confirming that aggressive adaptive steps are harmful at inference-time.
  – Error-gated update (linear gate) helped slightly but did not fully solve the noise-sensitivity issue.
The limiting factor is therefore the quality of the error signal injected into the state: small, noisy residual errors are still written, polluting memory and degrading Fuzzy-Recall and Compress.

2. New Modification Introduced Here
Sigmoid-Norm Error Gating inside the for-loop (file naïve.py).
Key idea: scale the error before it is written into memory by a gate g_i = σ(∥u_i∥).  Large true errors (wrong associations) receive g≈1, while small residuals caused by noise/round-off are suppressed (g≈0.5→0).  The gate is lightweight (one norm + sigmoid) and causal (state update happens after output computation).
Mathematical motivation: acts as an adaptive learning-rate proportional to error magnitude, reminiscent of confidence-based learning.  It should:
• Reduce memory corruption from noisy keys → better Fuzzy & Noisy Recall.
• Keep correct associations stable → better long-range Compress.
• Retain the strengths of DeltaNet on context-driven tasks.

3. Expected Impact on MAD Tasks
Compress: fewer spurious updates → longer retention.
Fuzzy Recall & Noisy Recall: noise-induced small errors get filtered out → higher accuracy.
Memorise: large errors still corrected, so similar or better.
Selective Copy / In-Context Recall: should stay unchanged (they were already strong).
Overall average should therefore surpass current Gated-DeltaNet (>0.71) across all tasks.

4. File Changes
• /mnt/…/naive/delta_net_4layer_sigmoid_norm_error_gate_state_update_in_for_loop.py – new variant saved.
• /mnt/…/flash-linear-attention/fla/ops/delta_rule/naive.py – overwritten with the same implementation so the rest of the codebase picks it up.
Both keep the same function name (delta_rule_chunkwise) and external interface; only the body of the for-loop is altered.

5. Next Steps
Run the MAD benchmark again with this variant.  If gains are confirmed, one can explore other smooth gating functions (tanh, swish) or combine this gate with the earlier softmax-attention idea for complementary benefits.
