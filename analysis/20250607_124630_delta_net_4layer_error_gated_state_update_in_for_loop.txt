Analysis
========
1. Current leaderboard ( accuracies_df.csv – averaged over 6 MAD tasks )
   • delta_net_4layer.............................. 66.8 %
   • delta_net_4layer_decay_state_update.......... 64.0 %
   • delta_net_4layer_momentum_state_update....... 62.0 %
   • delta_net_4layer_softmax_attention........... 71.0 %
   • gated_delta_net_4layer....................... 71.0 %

   – Delta-Net already beats Mamba / GLA on average, but is clearly weaker
     than the Gated variant on Compress (+0.07) and Memorize (+0.18).
   – Attempts that simply added decay or momentum inside the for-loop even
     hurt Compress & Memorize → they over- or under-wrote the memory.
   – “softmax-attention” helped Memorize (0.78) but damaged robustness to
     noise (Fuzzy / Noisy).

2. Problem diagnosis
   • Too aggressive updates for both small and very large errors cause
     interference and noise amplification.
   • We need a mechanism that lets the network decide *how much* of the error
     should be written back.

3. NEW idea – Error-gated Delta update (inside the for-loop)
   • Compute the prediction error  u_i = û_i – w_i S  (as before).
   • Estimate its magnitude  ‖u_i‖²  per chunk and create a *continuous* gate
     g_i = σ(γ · ‖u_i‖²).
   • Use the gated error both for output and for state update:
        u_i ← g_i · u_i
        S ← S + k_iᵀ u_i
   • Small errors (memory already correct) → g≈0 ⇒ protect memory.
     Large errors (true mismatch) → g≈1 ⇒ strong update.
   • γ is a scalar hyper-parameter (default 5).  Can be learned later.

   Benefits
   – Reduces catastrophic interference → better long-range retention (Compress)
   – Suppresses noise-induced spikes → higher Fuzzy/Noisy Recall
   – Keeps computational cost unchanged (only cheap element-wise ops).

4. Implementation highlights (see code)
   • All modifications placed *inside* the main for-loop, after computing
     u_i but before writing to state.
   • Causality preserved: state update still happens after output is stored.
   • File updated in both locations requested.

5. Expected impact w.r.t MAD tasks
   • Compress & Memorize: minority of steps already correct ⇒ small errors ⇒
     fewer unnecessary overwrites ⇒ higher scores.
   • Fuzzy & Noisy Recall: noisy keys create very large errors, but now
     output is weighted by g_i, avoiding pollution of the state, hence better
     robustness.
   • In-Context Recall & Selective Copy rely mainly on associative search; the
     gating leaves them unchanged or slightly improved.

Name:  delta_net_4layer_error_gated_state_update_in_for_loop
Success:  True – code written to both paths without breaking API.
