Key take-aways
• Vanilla 4-layer DeltaNet is already competitive with Gated DeltaNet on average (0.668 vs 0.710) but still lags on Fuzzy-/Selective-Copy and Memorize.
• Error-gated and decay variants bring small gains (≈0.01) yet not enough to beat Gated DeltaNet.
• Momentum and Adam-style optimisers destabilise the model – sharp drop in Context/Fuzzy/Noisy accuracy.
• Softmax-inside-loop greatly increases Memorize (0.78!) and pushes average to 0.712 – now on par with Gated DeltaNet, but still worse on Fuzzy Recall (0.16 vs 0.31) and Selective Copy (0.939 vs 0.997).

Effectiveness of previous modifications
---------------------------------------
• Softmax on intra-chunk attention helps out-of-order retrieval (Memorize) by forcing a probability distribution but does not address noisy-key robustness.
• Error gating/decay mildly improve noise robustness but at the cost of Memorize.
• Momentum/Adam are counter-productive because their accumulated gradients hinder rapid adaptation to new keys, hurting recall tasks.

New Improvement Proposed
========================
Apply **LayerNorm to the prediction-error signal inside the for-loop**.
Rationale
• The error term u_i drives both the output and the state update.  Its scale varies widely across time and heads (large when key is unseen/noisy, small when memory matches).  Uncontrolled variance leads to either excessive overwrites (hurting long-term memory) or vanishing updates (hurting adaptation).
• LayerNorm (parameter-free here) standardises u_i per token, stabilising learning-rate β_t implicitly.  Expected benefits:
  – Better robustness to noisy keys (Fuzzy & Noisy Recall)
  – Reduced interference leading to higher Selective-Copy precision
  – Maintains large corrective steps when necessary -> should not harm Memorize/Compress.
Implementation Highlights
• Insert `u_i = F.layer_norm(u_i, (d_v,))` directly after u_i computation and before using it.
• No extra parameters, cheap; keeps causality because S is still updated after output write.
File Updates
------------
1. Added new file: mad-lab/naive/delta_net_4layer_add_layernorm_to_error_in_for_loop.py
2. Overwrote core implementation in fla/ops/delta_rule/naive.py with the same logic.

Expected Impact vs Gated DeltaNet
• Should raise Fuzzy Recall/Noisy Recall due to error magnitude stabilisation.
• Selective Copy may reach parity (>0.97) because over-writing error spikes are dampened.
• Memorize/Compress stay comparable as signal direction is unchanged.

Next Step
Run MAD benchmark again to validate. If metrics surpass 0.71 avg and specifically improve Fuzzy Recall/Selective Copy, the variant will clearly outperform Gated DeltaNet.
