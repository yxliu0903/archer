Analysis
========
1.  Current results (csv)
   • delta_net_4layer…………………………… Avg ≈ 68.3 % (good on Context/Noisy/Selective, weak on Compress & Memorize)
   • delta_net_4layer+momentum…………… Avg ≈ 64.8 % (momentum harmed Fuzzy-, Memorize-, Compress)
   • gated_delta_net_4layer………………… Avg ≈ 71.0 % (best overall but still loses Context slightly to vanilla)
   Observations
   • DeltaNet already tops Context, Noisy and Selective but suffers catastrophic interference on Compress & Memorize; therefore the critical weakness is *forgetting vs. interference trade-off*.
   • Momentum did not help; it amplified old errors and reduced useful plasticity.
   • Gated variant helps Memorize (≈ +18 pp) but hurt Compress; its fixed decay may over-forget long-range patterns.

2.  Insight
   • What we need is *adaptive forgetting*: keep memories that are still accurate (small prediction error → small β), but quickly damp those with big error (large β) so that new associations can be written without interference.  None of the tried variants exploited the readily available β signal for this.

3.  New modification (inside for-loop only)
   Adaptive exponential decay of the state S before each read:
       decay = exp(−mean(β_chunk))   ∈ (0,1]
       S ← decay · S
   ‑ When β small → decay ≈ 1 ⇒ preserve info → good for Compress/Context.
   ‑ When β large → decay « 1 ⇒ forget quickly ⇒ frees capacity → good for Memorize/Fuzzy.
   Computational cost: one scalar multiply per chunk; no extra parameters.
   Causality kept (decay happens before producing output, update after).
