Analysis of Current Experimental Results
========================================
(Values are averaged accuracies across validation splits)

1. Baseline DeltaNet vs. Gated DeltaNet
   • DeltaNet already surpasses standard Mamba & GLA on the MAD average (71.8 vs 69.3/60.0) but still under-performs a strong 4-layer Gated DeltaNet implementation (avg ≈ ≈ 79.3, see csv row ‘gated_delta_net_4layer’).  
   • Strengths: perfect scores on In-Context Recall, Noisy Recall and Selective Copy showing excellent associative memory and noise robustness.  
   • Weaknesses: Compress (0.44) and Fuzzy Recall (0.22) are still low, suggesting poor long-range retention and fuzzy matching.

2. Ablation/Variant Trends (csv)
   • Adding naïve layer-norm, momentum, decay or Adam/RMSprop-style optimisation degrades Fuzzy Recall severely (<0.25) while barely moving Compress → they fail to solve the core weakness.  
   • Sigmoid similarity gate brings slight gain in Fuzzy Recall (0.18→0.22) but is not enough.  
   • Softmax attention variant raises Memorize sharply (0.78) but again hurts Fuzzy Recall (0.16).

   ⇒ Current variants show that just manipulating the state update without improving similarity computation is insufficient; Fuzzy Recall is primarily an approximate-matching retrieval problem.

Key Insight
-----------
Fuzzy Recall & Noisy Recall ask the model to match *perturbed* keys, hence the absolute L2 scale of vectors is not reliable. Cosine similarity (norm-invariant) combined with a probability simplex (softmax) should improve fuzzy matching while keeping global stability.

New Modification Introduced
---------------------------
Name: delta_net_4layer_cosine_softmax_attention_in_for_loop

What/Where: inside **the for-loop** we
1. L2-normalise q and k to build a cosine-similarity matrix.  
2. Apply causal masking then **softmax** along the last axis.
3. Keep the Delta update but use the **normalised** k vectors for the outer-product update over state S.

Mathematical Motivation
• Cosine similarity eliminates norm variance → robust to noise perturbations (addresses Fuzzy & Noisy Recall).  
• Softmax turns similarity into a convex combination → prevents negative or exploding weights that previously destabilised learning.  
• Updating with unit-norm keys holds S in a bounded manifold, improving Compress (less drift) and long-range stability.

Expected Task-Wise Impact
• Fuzzy Recall: higher because retrieval now relies on angular distance.  
• Compress: less over-writing due to bounded updates.  
• Memorize: preserved or better because cosine+softmax still allows sharp peaks for exact keys.  
• Other tasks: should at least match baseline; Noisy Recall may even improve further.

Conclusion
----------
The new cosine-softmax attention directly tackles the main observed weakness without destroying DeltaNet’s strong associative abilities. We therefore expect the average score to surpass the previous best 4-layer Gated DeltaNet.
