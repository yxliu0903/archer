Key observations from experiment results
---------------------------------------
1. DeltaNet already dominates noise–related tasks (Fuzzy-Recall 0.216→21.6 %, Noisy-Recall ≈100 %), but falls short in Compress (44 % vs Mamba’s 53 %) and Memorize (40 % vs Gated-DeltaNet 59 %).  These two tasks punish capacity saturation and interference.
2. Gated-DeltaNet’s main edge comes from an **extra forgetting / decay mechanism** via k\_cumdecay.  DeltaNet keeps every outer-product forever, so older memories crowd out new ones, hurting Compress & Memorize.
3. Historical accuracies_df.csv exactly confirms this: DeltaNet ≈0.40 on Compress/Memorize vs 0.58-0.59 for Gated; yet DeltaNet is equal or better on all noise tasks.  Therefore the missing ingredient is controlled forgetting rather than more expressive readouts.

Specific code issues identified
------------------------------
• In the current `naive.py`, the memory matrix S is only updated additively with outer-products and never decays ⇒ unbounded growth, loss of capacity, poor overwrite ability.
• The algorithm already contains efficient chunk math; we should avoid heavy changes that break this pipeline.

Technical reasoning for proposed changes
---------------------------------------
Modification: **Exponential decay of S at the beginning of every chunk**
    S ← γ · S   with 0 < γ ≤ 1 (we use γ = 0.9)
Rationale
1. Mimics the α\_t gating used by Gated-DeltaNet but in a much simpler, constant-cost form that fits inside one file.
2. Provides time-based forgetting ⇒ frees capacity for new key-value pairs ⇒ expected lift on Compress & Memorize.
3. Because decay is applied *before* reading, it does not corrupt the just-produced output (causality).  It also naturally leaves recent updates almost unchanged, so DeltaNet’s strong noise-robust behaviour should stay intact.
4. Computational overhead is trivial: one in-place multiply per chunk.
5. Hyper-parameter γ could later be learned, but constant 0.9 already gives principled 10 % fade per chunk, roughly matching k\_cumdecay’s e^{−decay·Δt}.

Expected improvements
---------------------
• Compress: better because stale, irrelevant memories no longer dominate the reconstruction after long delays.
• Memorize: fewer collisions ⇒ higher recall, likely surpassing 0.58 of Gated-DeltaNet.
• Fuzzy/Noisy Recall: should remain ≈100 % because decay only slightly attenuates, and error-driven updates still correct.
• Overall average expected >0.70.

Lessons from Historical Attempts
--------------------------------
Patterns
• Successful: adding gating/decay (Gated-DeltaNet) improved Compress & Memorize.
• Unsuccessful: plain DeltaNet without forgetting saturates.
How previous analyses informed current thinking
• We preserved DeltaNet’s error-driven outer-product (which helped noise tasks) but borrow the forgetting idea that historically boosted performance.
Consistently promising techniques
• Lightweight multiplicative gates/decays; maintain causal read→write order; avoid heavy extra parameters that slow training.
Building upon/diverging
• We adopt the decay principle but implement it as a *single constant multiply* rather than complicated key decay tensors ⇒ minimal code change, new variant not previously tried.
